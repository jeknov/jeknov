## Hi there üëã
I'm Jekaterina Novikova, the AI/NLP researcher. I am studying computational models of natural language. My research interests include natural language generation and evaluation, ML for health, and trustworthy AI.

## üßê Research
- ü§® I‚Äôm currently working on improving trustworthiness and reliability of LLMs.
- üß† Over the past several years, my team and I have studied the AI-based methods to detect cognitive impairment associated with dementia and mental illness from human language. This research has informed the development of practical healthcare applications used in clinical trials and senior care, improving the lives of people with dementia and psychiatric illness.
- üèÜ With my postdoc colleagues I co-organized the End-to-End NLG shared task that attracted NLG researchers from across the world and set a new research agenda for the field of neural text generation.
- ü§ñ My research on conversational models for human-robot interaction was used for a multimodal dialogue system implemented in a humanoid robot engaging and interacting autonomously with customers in a grocery store in Scotland and in a busy shopping mall in Finland.
